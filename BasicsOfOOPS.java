public class BasicsOfOOPS {
    //Using the OOPS we can solve the real world problems
    //While working with oops principles we should do few things : First we should identify the objects(objects refers to an real world entity)
    //The objects should have two things : HAS : Attributes(Technically variables) and DOES : Behaviour(Technically methods)
    //To represent an object, we should have blueprint of the objcte(Technically we call it as class)
    //Take an example of student : [HAS => Id, name, height, age](variables), [Does => study, play, drink](Behaviour)
    //class name should follow : "PascalConvention"
    //Variables and methods should follow : "camelCase"
    //We use "new" keyword to create an object

    //JVM data areas : method area, stack area, heap area, PC registers, native method area
    //Method area : .class file
    //Stack area  : local variables
    //heap area   : instance variables[objects]
    //PC registers : address of next instruction should be placed here
    //native method area : code of other languages which was required by java will be available here

    //When we are using the new keyword it is signal to the jvm to create some space to the object in heap area
    //After this the "hashCode" will be given and will collect by the reference variable
    //hashCode : it will give reference of the object and it will store in the variable

    //Types of variables :
        //Primitive variables : variables which holds primitive data
        //Reference variables : variables which holds reference of an object
        //Instance variables  : Inside a class, outside the methods of class are called instance variables or value of variables changes from object to object
        //Local variables     : The variables which is declared inside a methods are known as local variables.

    //When we create an object that time, memory will be created for the instance variables
